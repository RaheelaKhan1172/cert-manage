## Building

TODO: these are wrong/out of date

You can build the sources with `make build`. You can build only a platform with something like `make osx`. Please check the `makefile` for more details.

You can test out a specific platform with commands like `make run platform=alpine-35 flags='-find'`. They're based on docker containers and I'm working to add support under there for all platforms.
