## StartCom Issues

#### StartEncrypt

StartEncrypt was created out of jealousy of the success from LetsEncrypt.

Quickly after launch, it was discovered that StartEncrypt had a severe vulnerability in that certificates would be issues for domains not under the requestor's control.

> Recently, one of our hackers (Thijs Alkemade) found a critical vulnerability in StartComâ€™s new StartEncrypt tool, that allows an attacker to gain valid SSL certificates for domains he does not control.
